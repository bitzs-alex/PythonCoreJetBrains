title: Linear Regression from Scratch
language: English
summary: <p>Linear relationship estimation is probably the first kind of modeling
  we come across at schools. Linear regression is one of the most popular methods
  for estimating linear relationships and one of the most popular machine learning
  algorithms. This project explains how the linear regression algorithm works. These
  basics will help you with model interpretation and debugging if you want to fit
  and predict with linear models.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/195?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/195</a>
